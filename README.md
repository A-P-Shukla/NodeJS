# NodeJS Learning Repository

This repository contains a collection of Node.js applications created while following the ["Node.js Crash Course" by Traversy Media on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32M1al-Y6Ag). This project serves as a personal reference and a practical demonstration of fundamental Node.js concepts.

## Overview

The primary goal of this repository is to document and showcase the core modules and functionalities of Node.js as explained in the tutorial. Each file focuses on a specific feature, providing a clear and concise example of its implementation.

## Concepts Covered

The examples in this repository cover a range of core Node.js modules and concepts, including:

*   **Core Modules:**
    *   **HTTP:** Creating a basic web server.
    *   **File System (`fs`):** Reading, writing, and manipulating files.
    *   **Path (`path`):** Handling and transforming file paths.
    *   **OS (`os`):** Interacting with the operating system.
    *   **URL (`url`):** Parsing URL strings.
    *   **Events (`events`):** Working with the event emitter class to handle custom events.
*   **NPM (Node Package Manager):** Basic usage and package management.
*   **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Understanding and implementing callbacks and asynchronous operations.

## Getting Started

To explore and run these examples on your local machine, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

You must have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download them from the official website:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (npm is included with the installation)

### Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/A-P-Shukla/NodeJS.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd NodeJS
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies** (if any are specified in a `package.json` file):
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run a specific script:**
    Most files are self-contained and can be executed directly using the `node` command.
    ```sh
    # Example: To run the file system demo
    node fsDemo.js

    # Example: To start the web server
    node server.js
    ```
